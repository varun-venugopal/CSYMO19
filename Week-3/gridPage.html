The decision to elevate wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Rizwan as captain of Multan Sultans was an acknowledgement of his inherent leadership qualities rather than his recent red-hot form, according to head coach Andy Flower. Flower said his franchise hoped to play a part in Rizwan's development for the good of Pakistan cricket.


Multan's decision to replace Shan Masood, who led them to the playoffs last year, days before the sixth season was surprising - Masood was integral in trialling a system of signals between coaching staff and the captain on-field, a kind of real-time strategising as play went on. That was a system England later used in their T20Is against South Africa - Nathan Leamon, England's white-ball analyst was also with Multan. But at least partly it would appear the change is a result of a shake-up within the franchise. ESPNcricinfo understands that Alamgir Tareen, a prominent businessman, has now taken complete ownership of the franchise, in a move that has seen Ali Tareen, his nephew and hitherto the face of the franchise, moved out.

Multan insisted, however, that the decision was a cricketing one.

"Rizwan has shown that he's got leadership qualities when he captained Pakistan while Babar (Azam) was injured," Flower said. "He's also got a really good record in domestic cricket, recently won the T20 tournament for his state (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) so he's got the qualities to make a very successful leader. I don't know him well, but obviously been doing a bit of research on him and he had some of the leadership qualities that we're looking for for a new way forward. In saying that, I would say that I really enjoyed working with Shan Masood last year. I thought he captained very well, played very well, and was very much a part of us doing well lAndy Flower: Mohammad Rizwan 'has the qualities to make a very successful leader'
